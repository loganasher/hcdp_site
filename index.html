    <h2>HENDRICKS COUNTY DEMOCRATS WELCOMES YOU</h2>
    
    <p>Our mission is to help our county-wide and state-wide candidates get elected in a number of different positions. Each month we have a meeting with a special guest in order to inform Democrats across the county about what is happening in Democratic politics around the country.</p>
    
    <p>We want to thank all Democrats who voted in the November 2018 election and the big showing we had. Your candidates did well and we will continue to work to #Turn Hendricks Blue and elect more Dems locally! Watch this space for updates from the local, state and national Democratic party as we have them.</p>

    <p>Our meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month at the Avon American Legion in Avon, Indiana from 6:00-8:30 pm. Dinner is available for purchase. Bring a guest and if you have questions please reach out to our officers or on Facebook! (No meetings in May or November during elections.)</p>
